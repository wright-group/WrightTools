Alternatives
============

There are several packages with similar goals as WrightTools.
Your project may be better served by one of them:

- gridded_
- hyperspy_
- xarray_

Of course there are also the "default" python data-science structures:

- numpy ndarray_
- pandas DataFrame_

Those with general interest in array-oriented scientific data should be aware of hdf5_ and netcdf_.
