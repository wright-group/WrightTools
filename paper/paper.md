# Introduction

"Multidimensional spectroscopy" (MDS) is a family of analytical techniques that record the response of a material to multiple stimuli---typically multiple ultrafast pulses of light.
This approach has several unique capabilities;

- resolving congested states [@ZhaoWei1999b; @DonaldsonPaulMurray2008a],
- extracting spectra that would otherwise be selection-rule disallowed [@BoyleErinSelene2013b; @BoyleErinSelene2014a],
- resolving fully coherent dynamics [@PakoulevAndreiV2009a],
- measuring coupling [@WrightJohnCurtis2011a],
- and resolving ultrafast dynamics [@SmallwoodChristopherL2018a; @CzechKyleJonathan2015a].

In our view, the most exciting aspect of these techniques is the vast number of different approaches that scientists can take to learn about material quantum states.
Often, a number of these experiments can be accomplished with a single instrument.
The diversity of related-but-unique approaches to interrogating quantum systems is an important strength of MDS.

Advancements in optics and laser science are bringing ultrafast multidimensional spectroscopy to more and more laboratories around the world.
At the same time, increasing automation and computer control are allowing traditionally "one-dimensional" spectroscopies to be recorded against other dimensions.

Due to its diversity and dimensionality, MDS data is challenging to process and visualize.
The tools that scientists develop to process one experiment may not work when different experimental variables are explored.
Historically, MDS practitioners have developed custom, one-off data processing workflows that need to be radically changed when new experiments are undertaken.
These changes take time to implement, and can become annoyances or opportunities for error.
Even worse, the challenge of designing a new processing workflow may dissuade a scientist from creatively modifying their experimental strategy, or comparing their data with data taken from another instrument.
This limit to creativity and flexibility defeats one of the main advantages of the MDS "family approach".

``WrightTools`` is a new Python package that is made specifically for multidimensional spectroscopy.
It aims to be a core toolkit that is general enough to handle all MDS datasets and processing workloads.
Being built for and by MDS practitioners, ``WrightTools`` has an intuitive, high-level, object-oriented interface for spectroscopists.
To our knowledge, ``WrightTools`` is the first MDS-focused toolkit to be freely avaliable and openly licensed.

# Challenges and Implementation

There are several recurring challenges in MDS data processing and representation:

- There are no agreed-upon file formats. Files generated by researchers may have inconsistent internal conventions, and they often fail to be fully self-describing.
- There is a great diversity of dataset types. The same instrument is capable of producing datasets with many different combinations of scanned hardware.
- Dataset size may be large enough to run into computer memory limits.
- Dataset dimensionality is large enough to represent challenges in human interaction and visualization.

The excellent Scientific Python ecosystem is well suited to address all of these challenges. [@OliphantTravisE2007a]
Numpy supports interaction with and manipulation of multidimensional arrays. [@OliphantTravisE2006a]
Matplotlib supports one, two, and even three-dimensional plotting. [@HunterJohnD2007a]
h5py [@ColletteAndrew2013] interfaces with hdf5 [@hdf5], allowing for storage and memory-safe access to large multidimensional arrays in a binary format that can be accessed from a variety of different popular languages, including MATLAB and Fortran.
``WrightTools`` does not intend to replace or reimplement these core libraries.
Instead, ``WrightTools`` offers an interface that impedance-matches multidimensional spectroscopy and Scientific Python.

``WrightTools`` defines a universal MDS data format: the ``wt5`` file.
These are simply hdf5 files with certain internal conventions that are designed for MDS.
These internal conventions enable the flexibility and ease-of-use that we discuss in the rest of this section.
Instances of WrightToolsâ€™s classes dynamically interact with the multidimensional spectroscopic data within these files.
These classes are children of h5py classes.
``WrightTools`` offers a variety of functions that try hard to convert data stored in various other formats to ``wt5``.

``WrightTools`` defines a unique and flexable strategy of storing and manipulating MDS datasets.
A single instance of the `WrightTools.Data` class is implemented as a group containing many separate arrays.
There are two principle multidimensional array classes: ``Channel`` and ``Variable``.
Conceptually, these correspond to independent (scanned) dimensions---"variables"---and dependent (measured) signals---"channels".
Channels typically contain measured signals from all of the different sensors that are employed simultaneously during a MDS experiment.
Variables contain coordinates of different light manipulation hardware that are scanned against each-other to make up an MDS experiment.
All variables are recorded, including coordinates for hardware that are not actually moved during that experiment (an array with one unique value) or other independent variables, such as lab time.

There can be many variables that change in the context of a single MDS experiment.
The typical spectroscopist only really cares about a small subset of these variables, but exactly what subset matters may change as different strategies are used to explore the dataset.
Furthermore, it is often useful to "combine" multiple variables using simple algebraic relationships to exploit the natural symmetry of many MDS experiments and to draw comparisons between different members of the MDS family. [@NeffMallonNathanA2017a]
In light of these details, ``WrightTools`` provides a high-level ``Axis`` class that allows users to transparently define which variables, variable relationships, and unit conventions are important to them for representation and manipulation.
Each ``Axis`` contains an ``expression``, which dictates its relationship with one or more variables.
Given 5 variables with names [``'w1'``, ``'w2'``, ``'wm'``, ``'d1'``, ``'d2'``] , example valid expressions include ``'w1'``, ``'w1=wm'``, ``'w1+w2'``, ``'2*w1'``, ``'d1-d2'``, and ``'wm-w1+w2'``.
Users may treat axes like multidimensional arrays, using ``__getitem__`` syntax and slicing, but axes do not themselves contain arrays.
Instead, the appropriate axis value at each dataset coordinate is computed on-the-fly using the given expression.
Users may at any time change their axes by simply calling ``transform`` with new expressions.

``WrightTools`` offers a suite of data manipulation tools with MDS in mind.
Users can access portions of their data using high-level methods like ``chop``, ``split``, and ``clip``.
They can process their data using simple mathematical operations or more specific tools like ``level``, ``gradient``, ``collapse``, and ``smooth``.
Users can even ``join`` multiple datasets together, creating higher-dimensional datasets when appropriate.
All of these operations refer to the self-describing internal structure of the ``wt5`` file wherever possible.
Users are not asked to refer to the specific shape and indicies of their data arrays.
Instead, they deal with simple axis expressions and unit-aware coordinates.

``WrightTools`` offers a set of "artists" to quickly draw typical representations.
These make it trivial to make beautiful Matplotlib representations of MDS datasets.
Again, the self-describing internal structure is capitalized upon, auto-filling labels (including units, symbols, and expressions) and auto-scaling axes.
For higher-than-two dimensional datasets, ``WrightTools`` makes it easy to plot many separate figures that can be looped through using an image viewer or stitched into a looping animated gif.
A convenience function, `interact2D`, allows users to explore a complete dataset using matplotlib's built-in widgets.

# Availability

`WrightTools` is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/wright-group/WrightTools/) and archived on Zenodo [@ThompsonBlaiseJonathan2018WrightTools].
`WrightTools` is distributed using [pip](http://pypi.org/project/WrightTools/) and [conda](http://anaconda.org/conda-forge/wrighttools) (through conda-forge).
Documentation is available at [wright.tools](http://wright.tools).

# Impact

`WrightTools` has directly enabled no fewer than eleven publications. [@CzechKyleJonathan2015a; @KohlerDanielDavid2017a; @NeffMallonNathanA2017a; @ChenJie2017a; @MorrowDarienJames2017a; @HorakErikH2018a; @SundenKyleFoster2018a; @KohlerDanielDavid2018a; @HandaliJonathanDaniel2018a; @MorrowDarienJames2018a; @HandaliJonathanDaniel2018b]
Many of these publications have associated open datasets and `WrightTools`-based processing scripts which enhance the scientific community's ability to audit and reproduce the published work.
Although these publications span several different MDS family members and instruments, the common usage of `WrightTools` makes it trivial to download and immediately interact with the raw and processed datasets, and (when applicable) simulations that comprise these publications.
These practices are not yet common in the MDS community.

Though still relatively uncommon, MDS is an increasingly important family of analytical techniques used by Chemists and Physists to interrogate especially complex systems and to answer especially challenging questions.
By abstracting away common array manpulation, file management, and data visualization tasks, `WrightTools` promises to increase the productivity and creativity of MDS practitioners.
We hope that `WrightTools`, and the universal `wt5` file format, will become a useful open source core technology for this growing community.
We are particularly excited about ongoing projects that build on top of `WrightTools`, including packages for data acquisition and simulation. [@ThompsonBlaiseJonathan2018PyCMDS; @SundenKyleFoster2018a]
