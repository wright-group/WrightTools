WrightTools
-----------

``WrightTools`` loads, processes, and plots multidimensional spectroscopy data.

"Multidimensional spectroscopy" (MDS) is a family of diverse analytical techniques that record the response of a material to multiple stimuli---typically multiple ultrafast pulses of light.
Due to its diversity and dimensionality, MDS data is challenging to process and visualize.
``WrightTools`` is a freely available and openly licensed Python package that is made specifically for multidimensional spectroscopy.
It aims to be a core toolkit that is general enough to handle all MDS datasets and processing workloads.
Being built for and by MDS practitioners, ``WrightTools`` has an intuitive, high-level, object-oriented interface for spectroscopists.
