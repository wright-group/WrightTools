### issue TODOs

When opening a `WrightTools` issue, please follow these steps:

1. Search for a related issue. If a related issue exists, consider making a comment or editing that issue rather than spawning a new one.
2. Give your issue a concise, informative title.
3. Consider assigning someone to resolve this issue, perhaps yourself. Only assign someone if you are certain that they will follow through quickly.
4. If possible, apply appropriate labels (don't worry, these can be changed later).
5. If possible, assign a milestone (don't worry, this can be changed later).
6. In this text box, describe the issue as clearly as possible.
7. Delete this TODO list :wink:

Thanks so much!
