### PR TODOs

When making a PR to `WrightTools`, please follow these steps:

1. Give your PR a concise, informative title. Mark with "WIP" if your PR is not ready to merge yet.
2. Assign yourself and any other code contributors so it is clear who is making changes.
3. Give appropriate labels.
4. Assign a milestone.
5. In this text-box, use keywords to refer to associated issues e.g. `resolves #000`. See ["closing issues using keywords"](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) for more information.
6. In this text-box, describe the changes you are making and why.
7. In this text-box, consider making a list with check-boxes if you have multiple remaining tasks before the PR is merged.
8. Delete this TODO list :wink:

Thanks so much for your PR!
